Hello! I am senior undergraduate at [IIIT Delhi](iiitd.ac.in). I study [Computer Science and Applied Mathematics](https://math.iiitd.ac.in/math-btech.html) here. I love reading \[books\|novels\|papers\|blogs\] and working on interesting problems that apply/improve deep learning architectures. I have worked as a Research Fellow with the [Databases and Information Systems group](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/) at MPI-INF, Saarbruecken and have also interned at Philips Research and Microsoft India.

**I am looking for visiting research opportunities for Summer (May - July 2020) and Spring (December - June 2020).**

My research interests and full CV can be found below. If you feel that my profile fits your vacancy, please feel free to reach out!


### <strong>Research</strong> Interests

Yes! I love to do research projects! Why? Some reasons have been beautifully summed up [here](https://undergrad.research.ucsb.edu/2015/08/many-reasons-love-research/). 

Broadly, I find myself working on problems at the intersection, or completely in one of the following areas (order does *not* indicate level of interest :wink:): 

- Machine Learning/Deep Learning
- Data Mining
- Natural Language Processing
- Complex Networks
- Numerical Methods

More specifically, here are some problem statements that I currently find interesting:

- *Deriving aspect-based structure from unstructured text under minimal supervision*: Given a product review of a product like a "laptop", how can we extract what it says about various <u>aspects</u> , like "RAM", "audio system", etc. without any/minimal annotated data about the same. I worked on a similar, problem during my Research Fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbruecken.

- *Interpreting how Neural Networks learn from data*: Recent research in this area has been trying to correlate topological structures observed during training to different global and local features learnt from the data. This has been done mostly for CNN-based architectures till now. I would like to explore this area more.

#### <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

- I recently started playing the game [*Age of Empires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_HD_Edition), after being introduced to it by [Andrew](http://andrewyates.net) and [Simon](http://simonrazniewski.com/), and I am completely hooked!

- I love listening to good broadway musical albums. "Hamilton" and "Dear Evan Hansen" are some of my favorites. I also love Disney songs!

- I am an avid fan of [Pok√©mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon). If you want to discuss anything about the franchise from games to the anime, hit me up!


- As of January 2020, I have been to 4 countries (India, Australia, Germany, France), not counting airport visits :smile:
